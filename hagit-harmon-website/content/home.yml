  description: "My approach to therapy is grounded in Internal Family Systems (IFS) therapy. The psyche is viewed as an inner system (or family) made up of \"parts,\" each with its own role and intelligence. This work focuses on harmonizing this internal system so that inner leadership, agency, and self-trust can emerge."
